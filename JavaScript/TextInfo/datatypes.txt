js is dynamically typed language. it means variable wont have fixed/static datatypes

datatypes are two types
1. primitive -> consoders values 
   there are 5 popular primitive datatypes are:
   1.number ->
               Any numarical values are considersas number. sometimes mathamatical operation on number may result NaN(not a number)
               we can perform some mathamatical operations on number using math method and numbers also have default methods like toFixed, toprecision, toString
   2.string -> 
               b. strings: string are used to store charector/ letters/symbols any alphanumrical values
               string can be represted by ' ' or " " or ` `
               "" or '' have no difference in js

   3.boolean
   4.null
   5.undefined

2. non-primitive-> data types considers address. they also called reference data types
popular non=primitive datatypes are:
arrays
objects
functions
