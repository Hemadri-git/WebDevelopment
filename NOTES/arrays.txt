arrays are used to store a set of items/elements
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,"prasad"]
0 based indexing (0 to (n-1))
arrays are declared in using square brackets and it stores the data using indexs. index starts from  zero.

arrays have some default methods
--> arr.length  -- number of elements in the arrays
--> arr.indexOf(ele)-- find the index of first occurence of ele in arr
--> arr.lastindexOf(ele)-- find the index of last occurence of ele in arr
-- > arr.push(val) -- it adds the  value to the array at the end of the array. it can add and multiple values at a time
--> arr.pop()-- delete last element of the arrays
--> arr.unshift(ele)-- add ele to array at the starting of the array 
--> arr.shift(ele)--removes the first element of the array
--> arr.splice(s,dc,ins)-- it takes three arguments, s is the starting index value, dc is delete count , ins is the va;ue to insert 
--> arr.reverse()-- reverse the given array
--> arr.sort()-- sort the array in the alphabetcal order including numbers 
--> arr.concat(arr1)-- add arr1 to arr
--> arr.forEach(callback)--  runs the callback for each and every element of arr.  callback accepts first parameter as element and second as index
--> arr.map(callback)-- runs the callback for each and every element of the arr similar to forEach but it can return any values
--> arr.filter(callback)--  return only the values where callback return true
--> arr.reduce(callback, initialvalue)- callback takes previous and current valus and update previous everytime
